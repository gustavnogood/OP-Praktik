# Secure-by-Design
notes from the book Secure by Design 

Chapter 1
summary:
* It's better to view security as a concerne to be met than to view it as a set of features to implement.
* It's impractical to achive sequrity by keeping it at the top of your mind all the time while developing. A better way is to find design practices that guide you to more secure solutions.
* Any activity involving active decision-making should be considerd part of the software design process and can thus be referred to as design.
* Design is the guiding principle for how a system is built and is applicable on all levels, from code to architecture.
* The traditional approach to software security struggles because it relies on the developer to explicity think about security vulnerabilities while at the same time trying to focus on implementing business functionality. It requires every developer to be a security expert and assumes that the person writing the code can think of every potential vulnerabilty that can occur now or in the future.
* By shifting the focus to design, you're able to achive a high degree of software security without the need to constantly and explicitly think about security.
* A strong design focus lets you create code that's more secure compared to the traditional approach to software security.
* Every XML parser is implicity vulnerable to entity attacks because entities are part of the XML language
* Using generic types to represent specific data is a potential door opener for security weaknesses.
* Choosing the XML parser configuration is difficult without understanding the underlying parser implementation.
* Secure by design promotes security in-depth by adding several layers of security.
